### EXPERIENCE

AGFA HEALTHCARE (SHANGHAI) CO., LTD. | Senior Software Engineer | Mar. 2010 - 2018
--- | --- | ---

Agfa Healthcare CO., LTD. is a leading provider of Digital Imaging solutions. It is based in Belgium and has R&D sites worldwide with over 200 software developers.

__Achievements__

- Design and implement the connectivity middle-ware (EJB,JMS,JPA) that provides high throughput of message exchange between clinic departments. Based on my research and prototyping in Java parser generator (JavaCC), the middle-ware provides a proprietary scripting to customize message contents in high speed via pre-parsed expression trees in a cluster-aware cache (Infinispan). I am the major contributor and maintainer of this scripting language, as well as its configuration and development environment (Java Swing, JMX, Angular). I am also the sole creator of a language bridge, which extends the support of Javascript syntax in sandbox.

- Trouble-shooting software deficiency and refactoring source code (JavaEE, Java Swing, AngularJS) with legacy code base and 3rd party libraries. Introduce Domain-Driven Design to clarify code intention and to improve maintainability in the long term. Do knowledge sharing with team members to explain technical details (see articles in ref 6) in Scrum retrospection meeting.  

- Build up quickly and practice knowledge of Angular and other modern Javascript frameworks in projects and prototyping. (see examples in ref 7, ref 8, and ref 9) 

- Introduce Actor System to enhance the load test framework of connectivity module. I use the knowledge of Scala programming language and Akka to implement a simplified version of actor system to solve the problem how to create performance test that could be run in a distributed environment.

- Solid knowledge in the domain of health-care. Inspired by 3rd party libraries Hibernate and Entity Framework, I make extended use of a HL7 library (see ref 5) with the capability of message transformation and persistence and work closely with a large open-source community, dcm4chee (see ref 4) to upgrade a large source code base. 

- Follow Agile methodology and take a role as Scrum Master (from 2012 to 2015) in a development team (5 developers). Host daily stand-up meetings, planning and review meetings, and work with product owner to scope and deliver working product timely.

- Efficient cross-site communication with R&D sites worldwide. Participate in architecture and requirement discussion. Since 2014, I work with an international development team and do knowledge transfer at Shanghai office. I help build good relation for both teams and sync with progress for each other.

- Coach new members in Java programming language and other Information Technologies (see examples in ref 10, ref 11, and ref 12).

__Responsibilities__

- Designing, developing and trouble-shooting JavaEE application that meets requisite software development practices and requirements.

- Developing and executing unit and integration test plans, interfacing with other software developers regarding the results of tests.

- Participating in the architecture and design of software components. Contributing to the estimates of software component designs, and reviewing the work of team members.

- Embracing the agile methodology – Scrum and delivering working software for each development cycle.

- Acquires knowledge of industry and company standards with a focus on pragmatic software solutions.
