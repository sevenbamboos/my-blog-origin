### PROFILE

1. Graduated with a bachelor degree in computer science and a master degree in software engineering. Solid knowledge in software programming and development methodology. Certificated Java Programmer, passed [Front End Development Program(1)][1] at Free Code Camp through self-study.

2. Participated in the development of enterprise applications for ten years. Learned from the work experience the practical skills of Object-oriented design and functional programming paradigm. I work as a Full Stack Java developer and since 2010, join in a development team running Scrum methodology together with practice (e.g. Test-driven development and continuous integration) for a leading global provider of diagnostic imaging and health-care IT solutions.

3. Broad interest in a wide range of technical stacks (JavaEE, .NET, NodeJS, iOS), and maintaining an open-source [parser(2)][2] of Health Level Seven International (HL7). I also run a technical [blog(3)][3] and willing to do knowledge sharing with colleagues.

### EXPERIENCE

AGFA HEALTHCARE (SHANGHAI) CO., LTD. | Senior Software Engineer | Mar. 2010 - 2018
--- | --- | ---

__Achievements__

- Design and implement the connectivity middle-ware (EJB,JMS,JPA) that provides high throughput of message exchange between clinic departments. Based on my research and prototyping in Java parser generator (JavaCC), the middle-ware provides a proprietary scripting to customize message contents in high speed via pre-parsed expression trees in a cluster-aware cache (Infinispan). I am the major contributor and maintainer of this scripting language, as well as its configuration and development environment (Java Swing, JMX, Angular). I am also the sole creator of a language bridge, which extends the support of Javascript syntax in sandbox.

- Trouble-shooting software deficiency and refactoring source code (JavaEE, Java Swing, AngularJS) with legacy code base and 3rd party libraries. Introduce Domain-Driven Design to clarify code intention and to improve maintainability in the long term. Do knowledge sharing with team members to explain technical details (see [articles(6)][6] adapted for publication) in Scrum retrospection meeting.  

- Build up quickly and practice knowledge of Angular and other modern Javascript frameworks in projects and prototyping. (see examples [1(7)][7], [2(8)][8], and [3(9)][9]) 

- Introduce Actor System to enhance the load test framework of connectivity module. I use the knowledge of Scala programming language and Akka to implement a simplified version of actor system to solve the problem how to create performance test that could be run in a distributed environment.

- Solid knowledge in the domain of health-care. Inspired by 3rd party libraries Hibernate and Entity Framework, I make extended use of a HL7 [library(5)][5] with the capability of message transformation and persistence and work closely with a large open-source community [DICOM(4)][4] to upgrade a large source code base. 

- Follow Agile methodology and take a role as Scrum Master (from 2012 to 2015) in a development team (5 developers). Host daily stand-up meetings, planning and review meetings, and work with product owner to scope and deliver working product timely.

- Efficient cross-site communication with other R&D sites (Belgium, Austria and Canada). Participate in architecture and requirement discussion. In 2014 and 2016, I worked face-to-face with another development team in Belgium and did knowledge transfer successfully at Shanghai office afterwards. I help keep both team good relation and good progress for Shanghai team.   

- Coach new members in Java programming language and other Information Technologies (for example [1(10)][10], [2(11)][11], and [3(12)][12]).

__Responsibilities__

- Designing, developing and trouble-shooting JavaEE application that meets requisite software development practices and requirements.

- Developing and executing unit and integration test plans, interfacing with other software developers regarding the results of tests.

- Participating in the architecture and design of software components. Contributing to the estimates of software component designs, and reviewing the work of team members.

- Embracing the agile methodology – Scrum and delivering working software for each development cycle.

- Acquires knowledge of industry and company standards with a focus on pragmatic software solutions.
