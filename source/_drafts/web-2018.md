# Simplifying Javascript

## let over var

Because var doesn't support lexical scope. Instead, it's hosting. It makes it difficult to work with closure.
```
for (var i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
  items[i].onClick = (function(i) {
    return function() {
      return i
    };
  }(i));
}
```

With let, it can be simplified as
```
for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
  items[i].onClick = function() {
    return i
  };
}
```

## Object.keys()

Use Object.keys to loop through object properties
```
const object1 = {
  a: 'something',
  b: 42,
  c: false
};
console.log(Object.keys(object1));
```

TODO why [...object1] is not working?

## Spread operator as Array methods
```
const arr = ['Tom', 'Jerry'];
const more_arr = [...arr, 'Mary'];
const more_at_beginning_arr = ['Jack', ...arr];
const clone_arr = [...arr];
```

## Use Objects for static key-value lookups
```
const colors = {
  red: '#d10202',
  green: '#19d836',
  blue: '#0e33d8'
};
console.log(colors.red)
```

It's better than
```
const colors = ['#d10202', '#19d836', '#0e33d8'];
console.log(colors[0])
```

For the cases when data is continually updated, looped over, altered, or sorted, use Map
