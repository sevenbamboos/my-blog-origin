## Introduction
It's quite a long time after the last post. Although keeping learning in a systematic way in this period, I find it more difficult than expected to come up with a post with decent insight. Fortunately, I got an assignment in workplace to build a prototype GUI with Angular technology. It's a good opportunity to make use of the front-end knowledge from books as well as the articles I read on the internet. It's also the major source to let me write down the following words of my feeling and understanding when working on a front-end project.

## Installation
### @angular/cli
### IDE
### @ngrx/core @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects

## Reactive Functional Programming

## Sample Project

## To Be Continued
