# Multithreading, Parallel and Async

Multithreading
> A form of concurrency that uses multiple threads of execution. 

`Thread`, `BackgroundWorker`, low-level, best to start with high-level abstractions like thread pool.

Parallel
> Divide work among multiple threads that run concurrently.

Maximize the use of multiple processors of CPU. In most cases, work against built-in parallelism on server-side.

Async
> Use futures or callbacks to avoid unnecessary threads.
